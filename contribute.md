## Who can submit a model?

Anyone! If you have trained a small model to perform a simple task or if you know how to run a big new complex model, feel free to share it in `DeepZoo` so that other can use it too!

**Any framework is welcomed!**

## How to submit a model?

For each model you wish to add to `DeepZoo`, submit a Pull Request following this instructions:

* Create a new folder with all necessary files (this will be the model site).
* The folder should contain a `README.md` file with the description of the task and with (simple) instructions on how to run it. See [here](https://github.com/iitzco/deepzoo/blob/master/zhang_colorization/README.md) for an example.
* The model itself should be provided so that it can be hosted (as a `release`). It can be provided using a Google Drive/Dropbox/similar link from where to download it.

## If accepted

If the PR gets approved, then the model will be added as a `release`. The README will be updated to contain a `Download button` from where the use can get the model. Last, the new model site reference will be added to the main README.
